# üì° Beacon Rolling Minor Solution

## üîç Problem Analysis

### The Issue
- **Scanner works fine**: Can detect many beacons with their UUID, Major, and Minor values
- **Enter/Exit region NOT working**: The app wasn't properly detecting when users enter or leave beacon areas

### Root Cause Discovery
After analyzing the code using sequential thinking, I found the critical issue:

1. **Beacon Structure**:
   - UUID: Fixed (e.g., `E2C56DB5-DFFB-48D2-B060-D0F5A71096E0`)
   - Major: Fixed per beacon (e.g., 4470, 57889, 28012)
   - **Minor: ROLLING every 5 minutes** ‚ö†Ô∏è

2. **Original Code Problem**:
```swift
// ‚ùå WRONG: Monitoring with fixed minor
let beacon1 = BeaconRegion(
    identifier: "com.oxii.beacon.4470-1777",
    uuid: uuid,
    major: 4470,
    minor: 1777  // This changes every 5 minutes!
)
```

3. **Why It Failed**:
   - iOS CoreLocation matches ALL three values (UUID + Major + Minor)
   - When minor changes ‚Üí iOS thinks it's a different beacon
   - Result: Constant false enter/exit events or no events at all

## ‚úÖ Solution Implemented

### 1. Monitor by UUID + Major Only
```swift
// ‚úÖ CORRECT: Ignore rolling minor
let beacon1 = BeaconRegion(
    identifier: "com.oxii.beacon.major-4470",
    uuid: uuid,
    major: 4470,
    minor: nil  // nil = match any minor value
)
```

### 2. Key Changes Made

#### A. Fixed Region Monitoring (`setupBeaconDetection`)
- Changed from monitoring specific minor values to monitoring by major only
- Added support for multiple known beacon majors
- Now monitors 9 beacon majors from scan results

#### B. Enhanced Enter/Exit Handling
- **Enter Region**: Shows notification banner, updates UI, supports auto check-in
- **Exit Region**: Clears beacon info, supports auto check-out with 2-second delay
- Better logging with emojis for clarity (‚úÖ ENTERED, üö™ EXITED)

#### C. Improved Ranging Display
- Shows both Major (fixed) and Minor (rolling) in format: `M:4470/m:1234`
- Better distance and RSSI logging
- Tracks minor changes without affecting region monitoring

## üéØ How It Works Now

1. **Region Monitoring** (Background):
   - Monitors by UUID + Major only
   - Triggers enter/exit correctly despite minor changes
   - Works even when app is in background

2. **Beacon Ranging** (Foreground):
   - Shows real-time beacon info including rolling minor
   - Updates distance and signal strength
   - Supports proximity-based auto check-in

3. **UI Updates**:
   - Clear status messages for enter/exit events
   - Notification banners for important events
   - Real-time beacon info display

## üìä Testing Checklist

- [ ] App detects beacon entry correctly
- [ ] App detects beacon exit correctly
- [ ] Minor value changes don't cause false exits
- [ ] Multiple beacons with same UUID work properly
- [ ] Auto check-in works when enabled
- [ ] Scanner still shows all beacon details

## üîß Configuration

The app now monitors these beacon majors:
- 4470, 57889 (original)
- 28012, 61593, 50609, 40426, 2813, 4993, 36329 (from scan results)

To add more beacons, update the `knownMajors` array in `setupBeaconDetection()`.

## üìù Notes

- iOS has a limit of 20 regions per app
- Exit events may have 30-60 second delay (iOS optimization)
- Always test with real devices, not simulator
- Ensure Location "Always" permission for background monitoring
