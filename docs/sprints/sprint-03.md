## Goals
- Add SLCS, optional geofences, field‑test tooling, dashboards

## Stories & Tasks
1. **SLCS Integration**
   - Start/stop monitoring; relaunch to re‑evaluate presence
2. **Geofences (optional)**
   - Per site radius; mindful of 20‑region cap
3. **Field Test App Mode**
   - Live RSSI graph (dev builds), event timeline export
4. **Dashboards**
   - Kibana/Grafana for miss‑rate, exit latency
5. **Operational Runbook**
   - Known issues, how to triage, log taxonomy

## Acceptance Criteria
- Miss‑rate < 1% in pilot across ≥ 5 sites, ≥ 20 devices
- Operational dashboard and runbook reviewed by team
